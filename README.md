# arduino-uno-calendar-project
A final project in a hardware course using the Arduino Uno and programming in C to make a physical interface for a calendar.

This project was in cooperation with the charity foundation of "Hinuh L'Psagot" which is an Israeli organization that helps children from ages 8-18 which have potential for greatness achieve their goals. This project was created during the corona virus outbreak and as such is targeted to help the children conduct their zoom sessions with ease. 
After speaking with one of the orgenizers of the charity, we realized that one of the main progblems of learning through onlie classes, is lack of organization. 
It is hard for students and teachers alike to keep track of the links to the classes, and for the schedule that keeps changing all the time.
We wanted to ctrate a physical interface that will help with those challenges.

we created a physical interface that works with google calender in order to give easier access to links and keeping track of the schedule. 
# It has the following functions:
<p>*it has four buttons: one that is used to press TAB, one for ENTER, one used with the timer potentiometer (explained below) and one to open google calender.</p>
<p>*one potentiometer is used to move between weeks (moving it left/right will move the calender to a week after/before).</p>
<p>*one potentiometer is used as a timer. The student can set the timer according to the lesson length. as the time of the lesson goes down, the LED strips will change colors from red to orange to green. There is also a button that the students presses once he finishes setting of the timer in order to let the count down begin.</p>
<p>*one slide switch - to turn off/on the physical interface. When it's off, the LED strips changes colores between the google calender colores to make a nice addition to the student's table.</p>


<p>added code and pictures are in repository, including a video of the program in the simulator.</p>
